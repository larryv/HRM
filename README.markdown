# *Human Resource Machine* solutions

[*Human Resource Machine*][HRM] is a puzzle game by [Tomorrow
Corporation][TC] that uses a [visual programming language][VPL].
Dissatisfied by the game's limit of three programs per level but excited
by its ability to export plain text, I have decided to place my
solutions into version control, which is absolutely a normal thing to
do.
