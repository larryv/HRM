# *Human Resource Machine* solutions #

[*Human Resource Machine*][HRM] is a 2015 puzzle video game designed
around a [visual programming language][VPL].  Dissatisfied by the game's
limit of three programs per level but excited by its ability to export
plain text, I have put my solutions into version control, which is
absolutely a normal thing to do.
